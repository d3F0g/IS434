@Design__Pattern,The only huge difference is adding dark mode classes from @tailwindcss and an API call to @PlausibleHQ… I guess that causes a 7 second increase in build time…,https://twitter.com/Design__Pattern/status/1485470764694343682,"January 24, 2022 at 12:33PM"
@ScriptedAlchemy,@Design__Pattern @tailwindcss @PlausibleHQ Is it css or scss? Css in js or standard css,https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy/status/1485473867900461056,"January 24, 2022 at 12:45PM"
@Design__Pattern,"@ScriptedAlchemy @tailwindcss @PlausibleHQ Just tailwind v3, so I’m guessing standard css",https://twitter.com/Design__Pattern/status/1485474044337999872,"January 24, 2022 at 12:46PM"
@ScriptedAlchemy,@Design__Pattern @tailwindcss @PlausibleHQ Does tailwind have its own webpack plugin?,https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy/status/1485474369430118400,"January 24, 2022 at 12:47PM"
@Design__Pattern,@ScriptedAlchemy @tailwindcss @PlausibleHQ No it has it’s own config and uses postcss,https://twitter.com/Design__Pattern/status/1485474501961797632,"January 24, 2022 at 12:48PM"
@ScriptedAlchemy,@Design__Pattern @tailwindcss @PlausibleHQ Ahhh there’s likely the suspect. You’re introducing dark mode and now post as has a lot more to parse and optimize if it’s trying to reduce unused css. Minicss is usually fast but the loaders are what kills,https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy/status/1485474888416514049,"January 24, 2022 at 12:49PM"
